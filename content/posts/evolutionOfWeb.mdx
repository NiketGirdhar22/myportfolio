The internet has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past few decades, evolving from a collection of static pages to a dynamic, intelligent, and decentralized ecosystem. In this post, we’ll break down the core differences between **Web1**, **Web2**, and **Web3**—each marking a distinct phase in the internet's journey.

## Web1: The Static Web

Web1, often referred to as the **Static Web**, marked the very beginning of the internet age.

* **Main Features**: Read-only content; no interactivity
* **User Role**: Passive consumers of information
* **Technology**: Basic **HTML** and early **CSS**
* **Interactivity**: Extremely limited—no comments, no login systems
* **Examples**: Personal blogs, Yahoo Directory, early news portals

> Think of Web1 as a digital newspaper: you can read it, but you can’t interact with it.

## Web2: The Social Web

Web2 brought the internet to life with **dynamic content and user participation**. This is the web we’re most familiar with today.

* **Main Features**: Read-write capabilities, user-generated content
* **User Role**: Both content **consumers and creators**
* **Technology**: **JavaScript**, **AJAX**, APIs, databases
* **Interactivity**: High—comments, likes, shares, social media
* **Examples**: **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **YouTube**, **Wikipedia**

> Web2 made the web social—anyone could publish, interact, and engage.

## Web3: The Decentralized Web

Web3 aims to decentralize the internet and give users **ownership and control** over their digital identities and assets.

* **Main Features**: Decentralization, blockchain technology, token economies
* **User Role**: **Owners and governance participants**
* **Technology**: **Blockchain**, smart contracts (e.g., **Ethereum**), NFTs
* **Interactivity**: Peer-to-peer, trustless applications (dApps)
* **Examples**: **Ethereum**, **OpenSea**, **Uniswap**, DAO platforms

> Web3 is about trustless systems, digital ownership, and shifting power from corporations to communities.

The internet is no longer just a platform for browsing websites. It has become an ecosystem that supports **collaboration, ownership, intelligence**, and soon, **human-machine interaction**. Whether you’re building apps, trading NFTs, or envisioning the future of smart environments, understanding these phases of the web is essential.
