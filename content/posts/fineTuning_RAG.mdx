Consumption of GenAI models like Large Language Models [LLMs] is growing exponentially, but there are still some critical challenges to address:

**Model Enhancement:** Continuous improving LLMs to meet growing demands and up-to-date knowledge of the trends.

**Generalisation vs. Specialisation:** Current models are very general-purpose and often require further training of specific use cases

To overcome these challenges there are several approaches but two techniques stand out, ***Fine Tuning*** and ***RAG***

## Fine Tuning:

Fine-tuning involves adapting a pre-trained model to a specific domain or task using specialised data so as to tailor it to perform better in certain areas.

**Strengths:**
- Provides more control over model’s behaviour and output
- Domain Specific models obtained
- Enhances speed and reduces costs by embedding knowledge directly into the model

**Limitations:**
- Doesn’t adapt easily to real-time data
- Requires a large, labelled dataset for effective Fine Tuning
- Requires extensive computational resources for larger model sizes

## Retrieval Augmented Generation [RAG]:

RAG integrates external up-to-date information into the generative process. It retrieves relevant data based on the user input [input query], augments the prompt with the retrieved data and then generates the final response.

**Strengths:**
- Ideal for dynamic data sources like databases
- Keeps the model current with real-time data
- Reduces hallucination errors by also outputting the source of the output
- More accurate and context-aware outputs generated

**Limitations:**
- It becomes very complex to maintain the data flow and integration 
- Adjustment of model to work efficiently within the contextual window
- Can introduce latency due to external data fetching

## When Not to Rely on Fine-Tuning or RAG

While powerful, Fine-Tuning and RAG aren’t always the best choice:
- **Few-Shot & Zero-Shot Learning:** Great for adapting to new tasks without extensive training data
- **Active Learning:** Ideal when labeled data is scarce or expensive.
- **Multimodal Models:** Perfect for applications requiring multiple types of data (e.g., text, image, audio)
- **Model Compression:** Critical for low-latency or resource-constrained environments (mobile apps, edge devices)

## The Right Approach Depends on Your Use Case

- ***Fine-Tuning:*** Best for specialised, stable tasks with sufficient labeled data.
- ***RAG:*** Perfect for applications needing real-time, up-to-date information and source transparency
- ***Other Techniques:*** Consider few-shot learning, active learning, or model distillation based on your unique needs

Often, combining methods yields the best results — ensuring a robust, efficient, and adaptive AI system
