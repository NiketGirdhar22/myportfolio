Simulated Annealing [SA] is a powerful optimization algorithm inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy. Known for its ability to escape local optima and find near-global solutions, SA is widely used in solving challenging optimization problems across various domains.

## Key Terms/Concepts in SA:

- **Objective Function:** The cost function to minimize or maximize, representing the quality of a solution.
- **Solution Space:** The entire set of possible solutions.
- **Temperature (T):** A control parameter that starts high and gradually decreases to guide the search process.
- **Cooling Schedule:** The rate at which the temperature decreases (e.g., T = T × α).
- **Neighboring Solution:** A slightly modified version of the current solution, ensuring exploration of the solution space.
- **Acceptance Probability:** Determines whether a worse solution is accepted, calculated as  
  `P = e^(-Δf / T)`
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Balancing the search for new solutions (exploration) with refinement of current solutions (exploitation).

## Applications of SA:

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):** Finding the shortest route that visits all cities and returns to the starting point.
- **Resource Allocation:** Efficient distribution of limited resources.
- **Job Scheduling:** Optimizing task assignments to minimize time or cost.
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Allocating investments to maximize returns while minimizing risks.
- **Control System Design:** Tuning system parameters for optimal performance.

## Advantages of SA:

- Highly effective for large, complex, and nonlinear optimization problems.
- Can escape local optima to find near-global solutions.
- Flexible and adaptable, requiring minimal problem-specific knowledge.
