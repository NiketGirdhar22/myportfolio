Particle Swarm Optimization [PSO] is a powerful optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. It is known for its simplicity and effectiveness. PSO is widely used across various domains.

## Key Terms/Concepts in PSO:

- **Particles:** Individual potential solutions in the swarm.
- **Swarm:** The entire group of particles searching for the optimal solution.
- **Position:** Represents a potential solution to the optimization problem.
- **Velocity:** The rate of change of the particle's position, guiding its movement through the solution space.
- **Personal Best (pBest):** The best solution a particle has found so far.
- **Global Best (gBest):** The best solution found by the entire swarm.
- **Inertia Weight (Ï‰):** Controls the influence of the previous velocity, balancing exploration and exploitation.
- **Cognitive Component (c1):** Drives the particle towards its personal best position.
- **Social Component (c2):** Drives the particle towards the global best position.
