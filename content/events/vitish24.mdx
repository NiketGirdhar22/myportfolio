## VITISH'24 

This 24hrs hackathon was organised in 2 rounds.

Round 1 (Presentation): We had about 3-5 minutes to present our idea to a panel of 3 judges.

Round 2 (Build-it): It was the 24hr overnight hackathon where the selected teams from round 1 had to complete about 70~80% of the implementation of the project.

Theme: We chose Healthcare Open Innovation

**Team Members:**
- Shreya Gantayat
