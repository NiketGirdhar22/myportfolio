## Password'24 - CTF x Battleground

Password'24, organised by LUG-VITc was an 28hrs overnight event attened by 550+ events making it one of the major events ever in VITc. It had workshops for beginners taking them through complex concepts of cyber security and making them understand how the digital world functions.

Workshops focused on topics like Linux, Web Exploitation, Binary Explitation, Reverse Engineering and much more exciting topics. Apart from this, there were live demonstrations of Wi-Fi hacking and windows password bypassing. 

The CTF challanges were held in 2 rounds where first round was normal CTF questions. The second round was something new for everyone. The participant teams were divided into red and blue teams and given complex challanges.

As one of the management team lead as well as the student coordinator for the event, I was tasked with solving participant queries, making them understand the jist of the event and other managerial tasks too.
