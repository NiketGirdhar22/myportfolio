## Dynamic Street Lighting System

This project implements an arduino based prototype to a street light in showcasing the effect the streetlight atutomation may have if implemented correctly in a commercial scale. 

The prototype also had the provision to detect any faulty street lights over a particular region and the ability to turn on the secondary/emergency light incase the repair can't be done immediately.
