## Problem Statement

While planning to deliver shipments from say Point A to Point B, we have a lot of paths and transportation services available, but which path will give us the least distance? Or which path takes the least time?

That is something we need to find manually and it can be incorrect

---

## Agenda

- Find all the available routes from origin to destination
- Calculate distances and times of all routes
- Give back the path with least distance

--- 

## Technologies/APIs used

- Python 3.x
- FastAPI
- Google Maps API
- Searoutes python library
- Amadeus for Developers API
- Openrouteservices API

---

## Structure

- app.py  #had the FastAPI code to wrap the overall output 
- routeplan  #custom library
  - airways.py  #logic for calculating the route via air
  - seaways.py  #logic for calculating the route via sea
  - landways.py  #logic for calculating the route via land
  - __init__.py
