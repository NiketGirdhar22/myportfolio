## What is a keylogger?

A keylogger is a form of malware or hardware that keeps track of and records your keystrokes as you type.

---

## Features
- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures keystrokes, including special keys, and timestamps each entry.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts logs using Fernet symmetric encryption to protect captured data.
- **Email Notification**: Sends the encrypted keystroke log via email every 60 seconds.
- **Decryption Tool**: Allows decryption of stored logs for review.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.6+
- Required libraries:
  - pynput
  - cryptography
  - smtplib

---

## Notes
- Logs are encrypted and stored in `encrypted_keystrokes.txt`.
- Encryption keys are saved in `encryption.key` and this file is necessary for decryption.
- Email logging is set to every 60 seconds but can be adjusted in `schedule_email()`.
