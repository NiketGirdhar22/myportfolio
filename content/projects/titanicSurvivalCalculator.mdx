## Titanic Survival Prediction Shiny App

This Shiny app allows users to predict the survival probability of a Titanic passenger based on selected features, such as ticket class, gender, age, and embarkation port. The app utilizes a logistic regression model trained on the Titanic dataset to predict the likelihood of survival.

---

## Features

- **Survival Prediction**: Input a passenger's ticket class, gender, age, and embarkation port to predict their survival status (Yes/No).
- **Visualizations**: View various plots that provide insights into survival rates:
  - Survival rate by ticket class.
  - Survival rate by gender and class.
  - Age distribution by ticket class and survival status.
  - Model coefficients that were used to train the logistic regression model.

## Technologies Used

- R 
- R packages
    - shiny
    - dpylr
    - ggplot2

---

### Interpretation of Results:
- **Prediction**: The app displays whether the passenger is predicted to survive or not based on the logistic regression model.
- **Model Coefficients Plot**: This plot shows the coefficients of the logistic regression model. Positive coefficients increase the probability of survival, while negative coefficients decrease it.
