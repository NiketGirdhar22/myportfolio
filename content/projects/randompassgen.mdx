## Password Generator API

This project is a simple API built using Flask that generates a random password based on user-defined criteria. The API also allows users to input a string and apply Caesar cipher encryption to it before using it as part of the generated password.

---

## Features

- Generate a random password with configurable length.
- Option to include/exclude uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Encrypt user-provided strings using Caesar cipher and incorporate them into the password.
- Randomly shuffle the characters in the password for additional security.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
