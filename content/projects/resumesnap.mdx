## Features

### 1. **Resume Upload & Summary Generation**
   - Users can upload their resume in PDF format.
   - The tool processes the uploaded resume and extracts key details to generate a summary.
   
### 2. **Job Profile-Based Evaluation**
   - The summarizer now evaluates the resume based on the job profile provided by the user.
   - This allows users to assess their strengths and weaknesses in relation to the job they want to apply for.

### 3. **Readability Rating**
   - The system generates a "readability rating" for the resume, showing how well the system could process and understand the document.
   - Users can track how well their resume performs in terms of readability and how suitable it is for the job profile they are applying to.

### 4. **User Feedback Section**
   - An integrated review section allows users to provide feedback on their experience.
   - Continuous improvement based on user feedback is a key focus.

### 5. **ATS Compatibility (Future Goal)**
   - The tool is being enhanced to simulate an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) style rating system.
   - This feature will help users gauge how their resumes will be perceived by automated systems used by many companies to filter resumes.

### 6. **Job Profile & Job Description Upload**
   - Users can upload a job profile or even a job description document (e.g., `.docx` format).
   - This will allow the system to generate more precise recommendations based on the content of the job description.
