I had the pleasure of mentoring Niket Girdhar during his 3rd year as a student in my Operating Systems course. Throughout the semester, Niket consistently demonstrated curiosity, a strong grasp of system concepts, and a proactive approach to problem-solving.

What sets Niket apart is his ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, impactful projects. He worked under my guidance on a patent idea aimed at enhancing system security through zero-trust methodologies — an area where even seasoned professionals tread carefully. Niket’s commitment to research and detail-oriented approach made the project truly stand out.

Additionally, Niket collaborated on a research paper involving CNN-based classification models, displaying both technical proficiency in machine learning frameworks and a keen understanding of their applications. His ability to seamlessly bridge system-level concepts with AI/ML techniques reflects his versatility and forward-thinking mindset.

I am confident Niket will continue to excel in any challenging environment he chooses. I highly recommend him for opportunities in system software, cybersecurity, and AI research domains
