I worked closely with Niket during his internship at DigiMantra where he contributed to a project focused on AI/ML applications using Python.

Throughout the internship, Niket demonstrated a strong ability to learn quickly and apply new concepts effectively. He showed a solid understanding of Python and rapidly grasped core principles in artificial intelligence and machine learning. His work included data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation—tasks he handled with focus, accountability, and a clear desire to grow.

He consistently approached challenges with a problem-solving mindset, asked insightful questions, and was receptive to feedback. His performance reflected not only his technical aptitude but also a maturity in collaboration and time management.

Niket proved to be a valuable contributor to the team, and I’m confident he will continue to thrive in future roles within tech and AI. I fully recommend him for any opportunities he pursues next.
